The freecodecamp tutorial also gives a detailed explanation of the user input() and while loop, with a syntax example, which I combined with the knowledge from lesson 6 Udacity course.

I also used the pandas docs:

https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html

NumPy Manual https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/contents.html

I also looked at the git documentation to help with any specs on this publication
